In this discussion, a cantilever beam is analysed . The measure to which a structural member gets deviated from its initial position is called deflection. Here we have a cantilever beam with a point load applied at the free end. Using Ansys workbench we pictorially got the variation of total deformation, directional deformation about X,Yand Z axis , total bending moment, directional bending moment , direct stress , minimum and maximum combined stress. Also by parametric study we got the variation of maximum combined stress and directional deformation with length and youngâ€™s modulus . Also the interchanging of breadth and height of the element are interchanged and corresponding variation is shown
